# UFOs

## Overview of UFOs analysis
The purpose of the UFOs analysis was to develop a webpage that displays journalistic content about UFOs and data gathered from reports of UFO sightings. The webpage contains an interactive, dynamic table where visitors can learn in-depth information about UFO sightings. Visitors will be able to filter the table for multiple search criteria at the same time, which will then display the records of data that pertain to their interests.

### Conducting a customized search for UFO sightings from the data table 

The user can filter the table to examine data on UFO sightings after entering their search criteria of interest. The following example depicts the process to search for all UFO sightings on 01/04/2010 in the state of Texas:

  - Before typing anything, the user will see default "placeholders" in all of the search criteria boxes. These placeholders will prompt the user to know the format of how to enter data into the fields so that they can choose their criteria of interest:

## Summary

The UFOs webpage successfully provides an interactive, user-driven experience for visitors to learn more about UFO sightings based on multiple search criteria of interest. However this webpage also has some drawbacks to its design, such as lacking built-in features for the user to better control how the search is conducted and to make the entire search process easier. For example, one recommendation would be to add a button that the user can click to refresh the webpage after a search versus having to refresh the webpage manually at the top of the web browser. Another recommendation would be to add a button at the end of the search criteria boxes where the user can enter the data they wish to view and click a button for all of the search criteria to be returned at once, versus having the data returned after each individual change in the search criteria boxes. By adding these buttons, a user may find the webpage to be more "user-friendly" and the process of conducting the search can flow more effortlessly.
