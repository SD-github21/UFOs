# UFOs

## Overview of UFOs analysis
The purpose of the UFOs analysis was to develop a webpage that displays journalistic content about UFOs as well as data gathered from reports of UFO sightings. The webpage contains an interactive, dynamic table where visitors can learn in-depth information about UFO sightings that is customized to their interests. Visitors will be able to filter the table of data for multiple search criteria at the same time, which will then place into view the records of data that pertain to their interests.

## Resources
- Data Sources: data.js
- Software: JavaScript, D3 JavaScript library, VSCode, HTML

Below is a detailed description of how users can utilize this webpage and conduct a search to analyze data for UFO sightings:

  - First, the user will view the following images when they first visit the webpage:

  - A web app was built to develop an automated program that would scrape these data each time it is run.
  - The web app was updated to ensure it is mobile-responsive and included a few key features to enhance its appearance and appeal:
    - A color design scheme incorporating Mars' reddish tint was developed and implemented to provide aesthetic interest to the webpage (e.g., borders around images, background banners of color)
    - Font styling using bold, underline, and italics was added to key headers to help demarcate the various sections of the website
    - The four hemispheres of Mars were converted to thumbnail images with shadow backgrounds so that users can click to view the hemispheres' full-size images
    - A music feature was added to the top of the webpage so that users can have a unique multi-sensory experience of viewing beautiful images of Mars, learning important news and facts about Mars, and listening to the incredibly powerful and inspiring first orchestral movement of Gustav Holst's "The Planets", entitled "Mars, the Bringer of War", which celebrates Mars in all its glory
